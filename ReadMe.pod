=head1 Synopsis

    # Install a command-completion-definition repo from GitHub. Like Vagrant,
    # for example:
    complete-shell install ingydotnet/vagrant

    vagrant <TAB><TAB>

=head1 Description

CompleteShell adds command completion for everything, everywhere. It
provides a framework for common shells to define completion with simple YAML
or JSON files.

People can easily write completion definition files for commands that don't
yet have completion and share them with the world. They can also write their
own custom files, or fine tune existing ones to their liking.

=head1 Basic Usage

Here is a simple example. Define a file called C<~/complete-foo.yaml>:

    # Command name
    cmd: foo
    # Command options
    opt:
    - --aaa
    - --bbb
    # Sub-commands
    sub:
    - cmd: bar
    - cmd: baz

Then run:

    complete-shell make-bash ~/complete-foo.yaml
    complete-shell add ~/complete-foo.bash

Now you have command completion for the C<foo> command!

=head1 Installation

Run these commands:

    git clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/complete-shell
    # In your Shell startup configuration file:
    source /path/to/complete-shell/.activate

That's it!

=head1 The C<complete-shell> Command

CompleteShell adds a command called C<complete-shell> that allows you to show,
add and maintain your completion files.

Here is a list of commands:
